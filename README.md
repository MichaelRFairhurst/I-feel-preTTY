# I Feel PreTTY ## is a package for formatting scripts on ANSI terminals.

For the moment the only classes are PreTTYProcess and PreTTYDemo

## PreTTYProcess:
You can have outputting processes use its public methods or extend it.
I usually prefer to extend it.

### Main methods:
* < `->say(string $text, string $color = 'grey', boolean $is_bold = false)` >
> Available colors are teal, yellow, white, grey, and purple. They will
> not necessarily appear that color on a terminal since most terminals
> let you customize them. If your output is not indented, bold actually
> defaults to true.

* < `->indent()` >
> Indent the following calls of say()

* < `->outdent()` >
> de-Indent the following calls of say()

* < `->setTasks(integer $amount)` >
> progress bar and time estimate is generated by comparing the amount
> provide here to how many times you've called ->completeTask()

* < `->completeTasks()` >
> The progress bar and time estimate is generated by tracking how many
> tasks you've marked completed with this function, to how many total
> tasks you set with setTasks()

### Optional features:
* Progress Bar - ON by default
> Shows your percentage complete and estimated remaining time. You
> can disable this by calling `->hideProgressBar()`

* Cache Header - OFF by default
> Saves your 'breadcrumbs' and displays them at the top of the
> output. you can enable this by calling `->showCacheHeader()`
